        "\nIntroduction to TorchScript\n===========================\n\n*James Reed (jamesreed@fb.com), Michael Suo (suo@fb.com)*, rev2\n\nThis tutorial is an introduction to TorchScript, an intermediate\nrepresentation of a PyTorch model (subclass of ``nn.Module``) that\ncan then be run in a high-performance environment such as C++.\n\nIn this tutorial we will cover:\n\n1. The basics of model authoring in PyTorch, including:\n\n-  Modules\n-  Defining ``forward`` functions\n-  Composing modules into a hierarchy of modules\n\n2. Specific methods for converting PyTorch modules to TorchScript, our\n   high-performance deployment runtime\n\n-  Tracing an existing module\n-  Using scripting to directly compile a module\n-  How to compose both approaches\n-  Saving and loading TorchScript modules\n\nWe hope that after you complete this tutorial, you will proceed to go through\n`the follow-on tutorial <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html>`_\nwhich will walk you through an example of actually calling a TorchScript\nmodel from C++.\n"
